# v4-lp-visualizer  
**LP Lifecycle & Event-Driven Visualizer for Uniswap V4**

---

## What is this

A tool to visualize LP position changes, fees, custom hook effects, and ERC-6909 balances using Uniswap V4 event data and call traces.  
This extends my previous Hook Debugger (see: [[repo link](https://github.com/puffachu/uni-v4-traceAnalyzer)]) by adding event-driven insights.

---

## Why it matters

LPs currently have no clear UI to see how their positions evolve across swaps, rebases, or liquidity changes â€” especially when hooks are modifying behavior.  
This project makes that transparent.

## Key Features Planned

- LP range, liquidity, fee visualization  
- Chronological + dependency event graphs  
- ERC-6909 LP share tracker  
- Custom hook event parsing
